  <h2>Output files</h2>
  <p>
    DB migration has 2 output files:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Migration model XML</b> - This has the logical diff of the model as an <code>apply</code> or <code>pendingDrops</code> change set</li>
    <li><b>Apply SQL</b> - This is the DDL script of the apply changes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When the DbMigration is run it loads any prior migration xml and combines that together
    to define the prior model which is then compared against the existing entity beans.
  </p>

  <h4>Pending Drops</h4>
  <p>
    Only non-destructive changes are included in <code>apply</code> and changes like <code>drop table</code> and
    <code>drop column</code> are put into a <code>pendingDrops</code> changeSet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The drop pending changes need to be explicitly selected to go into a migration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given applications running in a clustered environment, pending drops typically need to trail the normal apply
    changes by at least 1 migration. This delay could be minutes, days and some drops might not ever be run.
  </p>


  <h2 id="migration-xml">Migration xml</h2>
  <p>
    When DbMigration is run the <code>diff</code> to the model is determined and output
    as the migration model xml document. This diff can have <code>apply</code> changes or <code>pendingDrops</code> changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the migration <code>apply</code> changeSet the actual DDL that will be applied is generated.
  </p>

  <h4>Logical changes</h4>
  <p>
    Note that the changes
    in the migration xml are database agnostic and a single migration xml document can be used
    to generate migration DDL for multiple databases. For example, you can generate migration DDL
    scripts for Postgres, Oracle and SQL Server from the single migration xml. In the migration xml
    you will see logical types like JSON types (storing JSON documents in the DB) and for Postgres
    that could translate to a JSONB and for Oracle to a CLOB.
  </p>
  <p>
    The changes are also "logical" in the sense that changes to entities with @History and @Draftable
    typically translates into multiple changes. For example adding a property to a @History entity could
    add a column to the base table, add a column to the history table and a change the triggers as required.
  </p>

  <h4>Example migration xml</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>apply</code> changes. The customer table
    has 2 new columns added to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the customer table has @History support this could also add columns to the history table and
    update the associated db triggers.
  </p>
  <pre content="xml">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
      <changeSet type="apply">
        <addColumn tableName="customer">
          <column name="registered" type="date"/>
          <column name="comments" type="varchar(1000)"/>
        </addColumn>
      </changeSet>
    </migration>
  </pre>

  <h4>Example migration with pendingDrops</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>pendingDrops</code> changes.
  </p>
  <pre content="xml">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
      <changeSet type="pendingDrops">
        <dropColumn columnName="shortTitle" tableName="document" withHistory="true"/>
      </changeSet>
    </migration>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Pending drop changes are not incorporated into the apply DDL script unless they are explicitly selected.
    Once pending drops are applied they drop off the 'pending drops' list.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apply-ddl">Apply DDL</h2>
  <p>
    The apply ddl script contains the changes that we want to apply to the database.
    This is the DDL script that you get FlywayDB or similar to run.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apply-drops">Applying pending drops</h2>
  <pre content="text">
  INFO  c.a.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration - Pending un-applied drops in versions [1.2]
  </pre>
  <p>
    The DB migration will log <code>INFO</code> level messages saying which migrations contain
    pending drops that have not yet been applied.  At some point it is decided to apply one of
    the pending drops as the next migration.
  </p>

  <#include "/_common/lang-buttons.html">
  <div class="code-java">
    <pre content="java">
      // generate a migration as the drops from migration version "1.2"
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.pendingDropsFor", "1.2");

      DbMigration dbMigration = DbMigration.create();
      dbMigration.setPlatform(Platform.POSTGRES);
      dbMigration.generateMigration();
    </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="code-kt">
    <pre content="kotlin">
      // generate a migration as the drops from migration version "1.2"
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.pendingDropsFor", "1.2")

      DbMigration.create().apply {
        setPlatform(Platform.POSTGRES)
      }.generateMigration()
    </pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    A migration is then generated with <code>dropsFor</code> set to the version of the migration that
    had the pending drops that we want to apply.  Additionally the migration apply ddl contains the
    various drop statements that will be executed.
  </p>

  <pre content="xml">
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="apply" dropsFor="1.2">
      <dropColumn columnName="shortTitle" tableName="document" withHistory="true"/>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
  </pre>

  <h2 id="version-format">Version format</h2>
  <p>
    The "version" numbering format supported is the same as FlywayDB version numbering where you may use
    "." or "_" (period or underscore) as separating characters.
  </p>
  <h5>Examples:</h5>
  <p>
    So <code>1.1</code> and <code>1_1</code> both translate as version <code>1.1</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that version numbering controls the order in which migrations are executed and follows semantic
    versioning so for example <code>1.1.1</code> would execute before <code>1.2</code>. By this means we
    can add a "patch" migration.
  </p>

  <h3>Workflow</h3>
  <p>
    If you use Ebean's migration runner to execute the migration note that to run a migration the
    <code>requirement is that the previous migration needs to have been run</code>.  This is slightly
    different from FlywayDB which requires either strict version number order (or we can disable that to
    allow any ordering).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are using a workflow similar to "git flow" then Ebean's migration runner allows you to
    process merge requests in a non-strict order. The assumption made for this to work is that in the case
    where there are 2 or more merge requests (that are being reviewed and not yet merged into a common
    DEV branch) will not have conflicting DB migration changes (If they do Ebean will allow the migration
    to run but the migration itself will error).
  </p>


  <h2 id="version">Migration version and name</h2>
  <p>
    For a migration the developer needs to provide the <code>version</code> and <code>name</code>
    and these can be set via environment variables, system properties or ebean.properties or programmatically.
  </p>
  <#include "/_common/lang-buttons.html">
  <div class="code-java">
    <pre content="java">
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.version", "1.1");
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.name", "support end dating");
    </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="code-kt">
    <pre content="kotlin">
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.version", "1.1")
      System.setProperty("ddl.migration.name", "support end dating")
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="programmatic">Generate offline</h2>
  <p>
    We can generate a migration programmatically without starting the application.
    In <code>src/test/java</code> add the following code with a <code>main method</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Running this main method will generate the next migration and starts Ebean
    in <code>offline mode</code>. This offline mode means we don't need to start the application
    or need a database to generate the migration.
  </p>
  <#include "/_common/lang-buttons.html">
  <div class="code-java">
    <pre content="java">
      package main;

      import io.ebean.annotation.Platform;
      import io.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration;
      import java.io.IOException;

      public class GenerateDbMigration {

        /**
         * Generate the next "DB schema DIFF" migration.
         */
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

          DbMigration dbMigration = DbMigration.create();
          dbMigration.setPlatform(Platform.POSTGRES);

          dbMigration.generateMigration();
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="code-kt">
    <pre content="kotlin">
      import io.ebean.annotation.Platform
      import io.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration

      fun main() {
        DbMigration.create().apply {
          setPlatform(Platform.POSTGRES)
        }.generateMigration()
      }
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h2 id="running">Running migration</h2>
  <p>
    You can run the migrations using <code>FlywayDb</code>, <code>Liquibase</code> or Ebean's own
    built in migration runner.
  </p>

  <h4>Ebean's migration runner</h4>
  <pre content="properties">
  ## run migrations when Ebean starts
  ebean.migration.run=true

  ## optionally specify different DB credentials
  ## to run the migration (own the tables)
  datasource.db.adminusername=myDbTableOwner
  datasource.db.adminpassword=secret
  </pre>
  <p>
    With <code>ebean.migration.run=true</code> then when the EbeanServer starts it will look at the
    migrations and run any that need to be run.  The migration runner will by default create a table
    called <code>db_migration</code> that holds the meta data about the migrations that have been run
    and inserts into this table when migrations are successfully executed.
  </p>

  <h2 id="repeatable">Repeatable migrations</h2>
  <p>
    Repeatable migrations are special migrations that start with <code>R__</code> and do not have a
    version number.  Repeatable migrations will run if they have not already been run or if there
    content has changed (MD5 checksum has changed).
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeatable migrations can contain any DDL but for ORM we use these for defining <code>database VIEWS</code>
    and for example using <code>@View</code> for mapping entity beans to database views rather than tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Refer to the second video showing repeatable migrations with extra-ddl.xml and use with @View.
  </p>
<@video_item "cxiacf0wmNk" "Repeatable migrations" "Use of @View, extra-ddl.xml and repeatable migrations"/>

  <h4>FlywayDB note</h4>
  <p>
    For use with FlywayDB currently we need to prefix "version migrations" with <code>V</code> in order to
    support both "version migrations" and "repeatable migrations".  To do this:
  </p>
  <pre content="properties">
  ## must use V prefix on "version migrations" when using FlywayDB
  ## with both "version" and "repeatable" migrations
  ebean.migration.applyPrefix=V
  </pre>
