  <h2 id="softdelete">@SoftDelete</h2>
  <p>
    Add a boolean property to your entity beans to indicate the deleted state.
    This property can be on the entity bean or on a MappedSuperclass as per the example below:
  </p>
  <p>
    This property must be a boolean type with a true value meaning that the row/bean has been logically deleted.
  </p>


  <pre content="java">

  @MappedSuperclass
  public class BaseSoftDelete {

    @Id
    Long id;

    @Version
    Long version;

    @SoftDelete
    boolean deleted;

  </pre>

  <h2 id="delete">Delete</h2>
  <p>
    A delete of an entity bean that has SoftDelete becomes a SQL update.
  </p>
  <pre content="java">

  // delete becomes an update if the bean has soft delete property
  database.delete(bean);

  </pre>

  <pre content="sql">
  -- soft delete  ... sets deleted = true
  update mybean set version=?, deleted=? where id=? and version=?; --bind(2,true,1,1,)
  </pre>


  <h2 id="deletepermanent">Delete Permanent</h2>
  <p>
    Delete permanent is used to perform a SQL delete (hard delete).
  </p>
  <pre content="java">

  // delete becomes an update if the bean has soft delete property
  database.deletePermanent(bean);

  </pre>

  <pre content="sql">
  -- delete permanent
  delete from mybean where id=? and version=?; --bind(1,2,)
  </pre>

  <h2 id="cascade">Cascading behavior</h2>
  <p>
    A soft delete will cascade along the same relationships as a hard delete as
    long as the beans support soft delete.  If the 'target' bean does not have a
    <code>@SoftDelete</code> property (and hence does not support soft delete) then
    the soft delete will not cascade to that relationship.
  </p>

  <h4>ManyToMany</h4>
  <p>
    Soft delete will not cascade to the intersection table of a <code>@ManyToMany</code>.
  </p>

  <h4>Draftable</h4>
  <p>
    Soft delete will not propagate to the associated "live" row of a @Draftable entity bean.
  </p>


  <h2 id="query">Query (normal)</h2>
  <p>
    A normal query automatically includes a predicate to filter out soft deleted rows.
    A predicate is added for each table (SQL FROM or JOIN) that has a soft delete column.
    This is done for any subsequent lazy loading queries as necessary.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    and t0.deleted=false and t1.deleted=false    ... additional predicates
  </blockquote>

  <pre content="sql">
  select t0.id c0, t0.name ...
  from ebasic_soft_delete t0
  left outer join ebasic_sdchild t1 on t1.owner_id = t0.id
  where t0.id = ?
    -- Additional predicates for soft delete
    and t0.deleted=false and t1.deleted=false
  order by t0.id; --bind(1)
  </pre>

  <h2 id="includeSoftDeletes">Query - includeSoftDeletes</h2>
  <p>
    A query can have <code>includeSoftDeletes()</code> set and in this case the soft delete predicates are
    not added to the query and this means all rows including soft deleted rows are included in
    the result.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Query.includeSoftDeletes()
  </blockquote>

  <pre content="java">

  // find a bean that could be soft deleted
  List<|MyBean> beans =
    database.find(MyBean.class)
    .includeSoftDeletes()
    .where().icontains("name", "rob")
    .findList();


  // find a bean that could be soft deleted
  MyBean bean =
    database.find(MyBean.class)
      .includeSoftDeletes()
      .setId(idValue)
      .findOne();

  </pre>

  <h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    For BeanPersistController, BeanPersistListener, L2 Cache and Cluster notifications a
    soft delete is treated the same as a hard delete and the same event notifications occur.
  </p>

  <h2 id="changelog">Change Log</h2>
  <p>
    For ChangeLog soft deletes are treated as updates as this reflects the actual change that occured.
